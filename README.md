# ISO11146 Laser Beam Analyzer

![](!docs/img/0_splash.png?raw=true "splash")

## Overview
- This code can be used for ISO11146 analysis of stigmatic and simple astigmatic lasers.
- This code was developed to be used with a [proprietary system][refFokPok] developed at [IFSW University of Stuttgart][ifsw] for online analysis.
- However, most of the code can be used offline script-based or via the GUI if a series of beam profiles are provided.
  - The latter is a scenario often encountered at the IFSW, as most processing stations are equipped with axis systems and appropriate camera systems.

- All you need to do is record images of your beam profiles along the caustic using your camera system.
- (Make sure to record enough near- and far-field images for a robust fit of the caustic hyperbola.)
- (Note: Background subtraction using a dark image/video is *risky* without specific knowledge of the behaviour of your camera system and setup. Pre-process your images this way if you are certain you are not compromising the data.)

## Usage
- **Without Installation, MATLAB >= 2021a**
  - Simply start the GUI via [startGUI.m](startGUI.m).
  - It is recommended to experiment with the GUI and [test datasets](/TestData) first.
  - For custom data input analyze your data via script: [analyze_example](analyze_example.m).

- **Using the installer**
  - Install the application using the [installer](/binaries/IFSW_BeamAnalyzer_standaloneÂ´)
  - The binaries require the R2021a (9.10) runtime. The installer will download the required dependencies if required. A full installation of MATLAB is not required.

## What do I need?
  - Built-in functionality includes various DC-offset removal / noise removal techniques including 
  [noisecomp][kovesi] from Peter Kovesi and [TV-L1 denoising][tvl1] from Manolis Lourakis.
  - Automated and/or GUI-cropping / pre-scaling of input for faster fitting etc.
  - Why image cleanup? Second-order moment determination of beam diameter/radius is particularly prone to measurement noise.
    - Warning: Due to the definition of beam diameter through the second order moments this means it's also possible to effectively falsify the ISO11146 measurement through usage of excessive denoising.
  - Additionally / alternatively an offset background image which is subtracted from the input may be provided.

## Workflow
- test
